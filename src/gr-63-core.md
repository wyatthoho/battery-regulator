# Notes of GR-63-CORE

## Equipment Handling

### Packaged Equipment Shock Criteria

Category B (> 100 kg) containers are subjected to free-fall, corner, 
and edge drops. The criteria below apply to Category B containers.

## Earthquake Environment and Criteria

Zone 4 corresponds to the highest risk areas, Zone 3 the next highest, 
and so on.

A **frame-level** test configuration is used for network equipment 
supplied with a framework. A **shelf-level** configuration is used for 
equipment supplied as a single shelf to be installed in framework by 
the purchaser.

The equipment tested is expected to meet **physical** and **functional** 
performance requirements.

### Physical Performance Criteria

Typical examples of permanent structural damage are bent or buckled 
uprights, deformed bases, cracks, and failed anchors or fastening 
hardware.

During **frame-level** testing, the physical performance of the 
equipment shelves, framework, and fastening hardware are considered. 
Permanent structural or mechanical damage of any of these elements 
constitutes a test failure. During **shelf-level** testing, only the 
equipment shelf's physical performance is considered.

**Frame-level** equipment shall be constructed so that during the
waveform testing of Section 5.4.1, the maximum single-amplitude
deflection at the top of the framework, relative to the base, does not
exceed **75 mm**.

**Frame-level** equipment shall have a natural mechanical frequency
greater than **2.0 Hz** (necessary) and **6.0 Hz** (desirable) as 
determined by the swept sine survey.

## Framework and Anchor Criteria

For framework used in earthquake risk zones, the **static pull testing**
procedures of Section 5.4.1.4 should be followed, meeting these
objectives:

- The maximum single amplitude deflection at the top of the framework 
  should not exceed **75 mm**.
- The top of the framework should return to its original position, 
  within **6 mm** when the load is removed.
- The framework should sustain no permanent structural damage during
  static framework testing.
